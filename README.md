Sliding puzzle created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using a scene from Spider-Man 3 as the base image.

I implemented an algorithm inspired by the Manhattan Distance Heuristic to solve it. There is a button to start the puzzle, one to shuffle the pieces, and another to solve it automatically if you can't. Additionally, there's a great animation when the puzzle is completed! Just be careful with the volume on your headphones.
